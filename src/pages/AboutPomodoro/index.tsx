          <Heading>The Pomodoro Technique 🍅</Heading>

          <p>
            The Pomodoro Technique is a productivity methodology created by{" "}
            <strong>Francesco Cirillo</strong>, which consists of dividing work
            into time blocks (the famous "Pomodoros") interspersed with breaks.
            The goal is to maintain total focus for a short period and ensure
            rest to avoid mental fatigue.

          <h2>How does traditional Pomodoro work?</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>1. Define a task</strong> that you want to accomplish.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>2. Work on it for 25 minutes</strong> without interruptions.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>3. Take a short 5-minute break</strong>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>4. Every 4 cycles, take a long break</strong>{" "}
              (usually 15 to 30 minutes).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>
            But <strong>Chronos Pomodoro</strong> has a difference 🚀
          </h2>

          <p>
            Our app follows the original concept, but with some improvements and
            customizations to make the process even more efficient:
          </p>

          <h3>⚙️ Time Customization</h3>

          <p>
            You can set the focus time, short break, and long break the way you
            want! Just go to the <a href="/settings">settings page</a> and
            adjust the minutes as you prefer.
          </p>

          <h3>🔁 Cycles Organized in Sequence</h3>

          <p>
            Each time a cycle is completed, a new task is automatically added to
            your history, and the app already suggests the next cycle (focus or
            break).
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Our standard:</strong>
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Odd</strong> cycles: Work (focus).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Even</strong> cycles: Short break.
            </li>

            <li>
              Cycle <strong>8</strong>: Special long break to reset the complete
              cycle.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>🍅 Cycle Visualization</h3>

          <p>
            Just below the timer, you'll see colored dots representing the
            cycles:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>🟡 Yellow: Work cycle (focus).</li>

            <li>🟢 Green: Short break.</li>

            <li>🔵 Blue: Long break (appears every 8 cycles).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This way, you always know where you are in the process and what comes
            next. No need to write it down on paper or calculate it in your head
            anymore!
          </p>

          <h3>📊 Automatic History</h3>

          <p>
            All your completed tasks and cycles are saved in the{" "}
            <a href="/history">history</a>, with status of completed or
            interrupted. This way, you can track your progress over time.
          </p>
